                <p>
                    Located just 20 kilometers north of Metro Manila along North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), Northwin Global City is set to become Bulacan's first-ever metropolitan hub for business and lifestyle, characterized by its own themed commercial district, high-rise residential condominiums, hotels, malls, mixed-use commercial buildings, educational institutions, and state-of-the-art office towers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Touted as a 'global business district', Northwin Global City will also carry Megaworld's iTownship features, such as the installation of solar-powered and LED streetlights, underground cabling system, fiber optic cabling, bike lanes, storm water detention facility for flood prevention, intermodal transport terminal, and other sustainable infrastructure for mobility and connectivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Northwin Global City spans the municipalities of Marilao and Bocaue in Bulacan. It can be accessed via the Marilao Exit of NLEX and will be just 20 minutes away from the proposed New Manila International Airport in Bulacan, and just five minutes away from the Philippine Arena.

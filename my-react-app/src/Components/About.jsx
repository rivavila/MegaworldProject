          The Company was founded by Andrew Tan and incorporated under
          Philippine law on August 24, 1989 to engage in the development,
          leasing and marketing of real estate. The Company initially
          established a reputation for building high-end residential
          condominiums and commercial properties located in convenient urban
          locations with easy access to offices as well as leisure and
          entertainment amenities in Metro Manila. Beginning in 1996, in
          response to demand for the lifestyle convenience of having quality
          residences in close proximity to office and leisure facilities, the
          Company began to focus on the development of mixed-use communities,
          primarily for the middle-income market, by commencing the development
          of its Eastwood City community township. In addition, the Company
          engages in other property related activities such as project design,
          construction oversight and property management. In 1999, Eastwood City
          Cyberpark became the first IT park in the Philippines to be designated
          a PEZA special economic zone.
